🧙‍♂️ Gandalf Detector – 2FA Wallet Security for Venn Network

    "You shall not pass... without 2FA." – Gandalf (probably)

Gandalf Detector is a security-first transaction detection and authorization tool for wallets on the Venn Network. It integrates Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Discord, enabling users to add strong protection to sensitive operations like high-value transfers or contract interactions.

🚀 Overview

The Gandalf Detector lets users enforce 2FA on their Venn-based wallets by requiring confirmation via Discord before executing high-risk transactions.

Powered by a smart contract for on-chain enrollment and paired with a Discord bot, Gandalf acts as the wise gatekeeper of your wallet—blocking unauthorized or risky operations with multi-layered verification.
